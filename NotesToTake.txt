After coding i followed the below steps:
1. open terminal and hit command cd to my project(cd src/com/tinyiko)
2. hit command ls(ls) and on the results there is Main.java listed
3. hit command javac to read the byte code and transform in into java code(javac Main.java) it then created Main.java file
