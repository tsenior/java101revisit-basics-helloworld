/**

 *  -
 * > Polymorphism
 *
 *
 * 1) Create a Customer class that has the following attributes:
 * name, SSN.
 * 2) This class should have two methods: getName() and getSSN().
 * 3) If the class is instantiated with only a SSN, then give the default name of "John Doe". (HINT: Use two constructors)
 * 4) Also, add a method toString(), that returns a string representation of the customer object (name and SSN concatenated).
 *      Make sure to set this method public.
 * 5) Create a class to test your program (e.g. a class that include the main() method). In your test program, instantiate
 *      three customers and print out the value using toString() method.
